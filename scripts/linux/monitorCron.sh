# Backups of the originals are saved at /var/spool/backupCron
# Quarantined files are located at /var/spool/quarantineCron
# Additionally, if the number of files between backup and in use changes, that is noted in the log file
# Finally, if a name discrepancy is detected, the file is moved to quarantine and a note is made in the log file
